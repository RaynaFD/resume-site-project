# resume-site-project
A multipage resume site.
At the moment it only contains HTML, I am hoping to add to it more as i learn more languages.
Eventually I'd like to use it as an actual resume or at least the template for an eventual web dev CV seperate from the portfolio site. 
One day I'll combine the two.
